Test Conditions:
	1:
	Noise = 0 (Only Polling)
	Q = 1.00 (50 50 Split)
	Decision Prob.= 1.0 (Direct Switch: 100%)
	
	Findings:
		The swarm randomly switches to either decision A or Decision B and then that decision is reinforced more and more and over time all robots go to one decision, I presume
		this is because there is no negative feedback in the system so once there is a higher number of A or B robot the probability of swithing to that increases and it keeps getting
		reinforced.
